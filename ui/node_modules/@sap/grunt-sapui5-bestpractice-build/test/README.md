# Testing framework
## Unit tests: Grunt task: 'unitTests'

Using moca, chai, sinon, rewire

Code coverage and linting enforced.

All test/*Spec.js files are executed

Some guidelines

•	Keep task in seperated file

•	Create a function for the task logic and call the function from registerTask

•	Rewire package can be used to test private function.

## Integration tests: Grunt task: 'integrationTests'

Using moca, chai

All test/*Integration.js files are executed

Runs on projects under test/dummy and executes the dummy project's gruntfile agains local best practice code.

Steps during the integration test task:

•	Clean: Cleanup from previous execusion

•	shell:setupIntegrationTests – calls a shell script to pack the local best practice package  and rename it to sap-grunt-sapui5-bestpractice.tgz (without version)

•	auto_install – calls npm install on the tested dummy projects

•	mochaTest:integrations – runs the tests
